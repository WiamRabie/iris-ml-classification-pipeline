# Iris Species Classification – Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete supervised machine learning workflow
to classify Iris flower species using numerical features.
Two models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest) are trained, tuned,
and evaluated using cross-validation.

## Pipeline
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature preprocessing (standardization)
- Model training (KNN, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Key Results
- KNN (k=3): 100% test accuracy, 92.5% average CV accuracy
- Random Forest: 100% test accuracy with tuned hyperparameters
- Strong and stable performance across all classes

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. No additional setup or retraining is required

## Tech Stack
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
